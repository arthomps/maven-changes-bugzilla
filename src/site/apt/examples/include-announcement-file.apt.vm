Include an Announcement File in Your Packaging

  Since version 2.4 this plugin has options that allows you to put the generated
  announcement file anywhere you like. This makes it possible to include the
  generated announcement in your packaging.

* Configuring the Plugin

  In this example we want to call the generated announcement file
  <<<CHANGES.txt>>> and have it put into the <<<META-INF>>> directory of the
  project's JAR file. To do this we configure the Changes Plugin like this:

+-----------------+
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-changes-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>include-announcement-file</id>
            <phase>generate-resources</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>announcement-generate</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <announcementFile>CHANGES.txt</announcementFile>
              <outputDirectory>\${project.build.outputDirectory}/META-INF</outputDirectory>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+-----------------+
