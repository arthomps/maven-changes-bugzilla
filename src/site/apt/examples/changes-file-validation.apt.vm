Validate Your changes.xml File

 Since 2.1, a {{{../changes-validate-mojo.html}goal}} is
 provided to validate your <<<changes.xml>>> file.

 You can attach this goal to the <<<pre-site>>> phase if you want the
 validation to be performed automatically when you generate the site.

* Configuring the Plugin

 First you must configure the plugin and tell it to validate your <<<changes.xml>>> file.
