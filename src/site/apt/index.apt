Maven Changes Plugin

  This plugin is used to inform your users of the changes that have occured
  between different releases of your project. The plugin can extract these
  changes, either from a <<<changes.xml>>> file or from the JIRA issue
  management system, and present them as a report. You also have the option of
  creating a release announcement and even sending this via email to your
  users.

* Goals Overview

  * {{{./announcement-mail-mojo.html}changes:announcement-mail}} send a release announcement via email.

  * {{{./announcement-generate-mojo.html}changes:announcement-generate}} generate a release announcement.

  * {{{./changes-check-mojo.html}changes:changes-check}} check that the <<<changes.xml>>> file contains a valid release date.

  * {{{./changes-report-mojo.html}changes:changes-report}} create a report showing what has changed between different releases of the project.

  * {{{./changes-validate-mojo.html}changes:changes-validate}} validate the <<<changes.xml>>> file.

  * {{{./jira-report-mojo.html}changes:jira-report}} create a report from issues downloaded from {{{http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/}JIRA}}.

  * {{{./trac-report-mojo.html}changes:trac-report}} create a report from issues downloaded from {{{http://trac.edgewall.org/}Trac}}.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Changes Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below. Last but not least, users occasionally contribute
  additional examples, tips or errata to the
  {{{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/Changes+Plugin}plugin's wiki page}}.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{./faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{./mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{./mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.
